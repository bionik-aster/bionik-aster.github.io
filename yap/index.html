      <hr/>
      <p>Sometimes I wish I'm in a relationship but at the same time I <i>don't</i>. Shit with Melony happened as did shit with Willow and other people. I don't want to go back there. I don't want to be groomed, I don't want to be the centre of attention
      of the entire school, you get me? It's really fucking tiring. But I can't help but be jealous. Why can other people have such... healthy relationships? Why can't I ever have one like that? Then I shut myself off again. I just really, really am
      trauma-ridden from the past. I guess it's part of human life.</p>
