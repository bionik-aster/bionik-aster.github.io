      <h1>Climate Change</h1>
      <h3 id="climchange">What is climate change?</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>In a nutshell, climate change refers to the rapid <b>change</b> in <b>climate</b>, generally on Earth.</p>
      <p>
        However, climate change is not a one-off event, and it is not entirely human-caused though human activity
        has severely accelerated this change.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3 id="causes">What are the causes of climate change?</h3>
      <hr>
      <h4>Human causes</h4>
      <p>
        Climate change is accelerated by human activity such as the burning of fossil fuels (e.g. coal, oil, gas),
        and these activities cause CO&#8322; and methane buildup, both of which are <b>greenhouse gases</b>.
        These gases trap heat within Earth's atmosphere and keeps it warm, but also can harm Earth if more gases
        affect the natural greenhouse effect.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Natural causes</h4>
      <p>
        Natural causes are events such as Milankovitch cycles, sunspot cycles, and glacial/interglacial periods
        that naturally affect how much sunlight and heat Earth receives.
      </p>
      <h5>Milankovitch cycles</h5>
      <p>
        The collective effect of multiple aspects that affect Earth's climate, such as eccentricity
        (how elliptical Earth's orbit around the Sun is) and obliquity (aka <i>axial tilt</i> which is defined as
        the angle between the axis of rotation and normal to its orbital plane).
      </p>
      <h5>Sunspot cycles</h5>
      <p>
        Aka <b>Solar cycles</b> or <b>Schwabe cycles</b>, they are periodic changes in the Sun's activity over
        11 years, measured in the amount of sunspots present. At a solar <i>maximum</i>, Earth experiences
        higher temperatures as sunpots and coronal ejections blast solar radiation. At a solr <i>minimum</i>, the
        opposite happens.
