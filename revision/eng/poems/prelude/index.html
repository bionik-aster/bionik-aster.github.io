      <h1>The Prelude: Stealing the Boat by William Wordsworth</h1>
      <h3 id="quote1">"Stealth"</h3>
      <p>This quote appears in the opening lines:</p>
      <q>It was an act of stealth / And troubled pleasure</q>
      <ul>
        <li>&star; "Stealth" establishes the poem's moral ambiguity - it suggests secrecy, wrongdoing, and transgression.</li>
        <li>&star; The following line provides us with the oxymoron "troubled pleasure", indicating the thrill of the action, but also the inner resentment
            that he holds.
        </li>
        <li>&star; To a broader extent, "Stealth" foreshadows the darker turns in the poem as Wordsworth becomes overwhelmed by the power of nature.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="quote2">"Huge peak"</h3>
      <p>This quote appears in the later lines when Wordsworth becomes awestruck by the mountains:</p>
      <q>a huge peak, black and huge</q>
      <ul>
        <li>&star; The repetition of the adjective "huge" suggests that Wordsworth was too shocked to find words to articulate his feelings.</li>
        <li>&star; Additionally, it could also emphasise how the mountain dominates and intimidates him.</li>
        <li>&star; If we look further into the line, the "black" that separates the two "huge"s adds a more sinister tone to the mountain,
            as black is often connoted with mysteriousness, and a sense of foreboding which Wordsworth experiences in that moment.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="quote3">"Darkness... Solitude... blank desertion"</h3>
      <p>Towards the very end of the extract, Wordsworth says this:</p>
      <q>There was a darkness – call it solitude, / Or blank desertion</q>
      <ul>
        <li>&star; Both "solitude" and "blank desertion" reflect that Wordsworth is aware of his limitations; of his loneliness. He feels
            "desert[ed]" by the overwhelming nature.
        </li>
        <li>&star; "Darkness" relates to the "solitude" that Wordsworth experiences, by emphasising the void that the power of nature instills.</li>
      </ul>
