        <p>To whoever finds this, I'm ok, for now at least. There's been a few people who keep making me feel uncomfortable and calling it off as banter but it could be infinitely worse, really.
        Good thing I'm not resorting to multitudes of psychological coping mechanisms yet lmao</p>

        of the entire school, you get me? It's really fucking tiring. But I can't help but be jealous. Why can other people have such... healthy relationships? Why can't I ever have one like that? Then I shut myself off again. I just really, really am
        trauma-ridden from the past. I guess it's part of human life.</p>
